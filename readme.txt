Using this plugin, you can add schema code to WordPress categories.

== Description ==

By default, you cannot add schema code to WordPress categories. There are several plugins that you can use to add schema code to categories.
But using multiple plugins is very harmful. You can easily insert the schema code at the end of articles and products. But, this is not possible for WordPress categories.
By using the "Add Schema to WordPress Categories" plugin, you will be able to add schema codes to the end of the category description.

Plugin features:
Sorting the schema code into categories
Determining whether the schema is correct
Saving the schema code in the database and using it
Lightness of the plugin and compatibility with WooCommerce categories

== Installation ==

1- In the plugins section of your site, search for "adding schema to WordPress categories" and install the plugin. (You can download the plugin from the wordpress.org site and upload it to your host in the wp-content/plugin folder. After uploading, activate the plugin in the plugin management section.)
2- A new meta box has been added in the WordPress categories section (WooCommerce product categories) where you can put the schema codes and update the category.
3- In the category schema menu, you can get a complete guide for using the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it possible to use all websites? =

Yes, you can use this plugin on any website you have.

= Is coding required? = 
As explained in the help section, if you have used the default WordPress and WooCommerce functions to call the category description, the plugin will automatically insert the schema code at the end of the description. If you have not used the default functions, just read the plugin guide and call the desired function in the appropriate place.
